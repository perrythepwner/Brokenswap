# TL;DR

- The challenge consist in finding a way to steal funds from a Decentralized Exchange (DEX). The DEX relies con the *Constant Product Formula* to calculate prices of the assets and it's possible to cause an imbalance in the pool (and therefore make profitable trades) calling the `_moveAmountToFeesPool()` - incorrectly marked with the modifier `public` instead of `internal` - to move arbitrary tokens out of the liquidity pool.

# Description

```
Legend has it that a long time ago, a mysterious tech-wizard from Vault 13 crafted this DEX to ensure that only those flush with WETH tokens could wield power in the wasteland's Ã©lite circles.
Entry costs 15 WETH, and we're fresh out. All we have left are a few ETH salvaged from previous challenges, but no wastelander has ever managed to scavenge any WETH.
It's been ages, and WETH is nowhere to be found except in the depths of this DEX, which seems unbreakable...
```

# Skills Required

## Challenge background

In the wild world of DeFi, with an ever-increasing number of users, protocols, circulating liquidity, security has become more important than ever.  
Sometimes, indeed often, people and developers tend to make trivial mistakes.  
It happens.
After all, we all are human.  
But for this reason it becomes essential to have the code audited several times and by different sources before deploying it.  
And if someone don't have sufficient funds, they can always resort to using well-known and well-audited external libraries.

This real-world challenge takes inspiration from the recent **LeetSwap hack** that occurred on August 1, 2023 causing a **loss of 340 ETH (approximately $624,000 at the time) due to an Access Control vulnerability** in the `_transferFeesSupportingTaxTokens()` function which was intended to be an `internal` function (note the trailing underscore) but was `public` modifier incorrectly assigned. Read more [here](https://medium.com/coinmonks/leetswap-hack-analysis-81323527b3f7).  
An oversight worth more than half a million dollars.  
Players in this challenge will go through all the basic concepts of the functioning of Smart contracts, ERC 20, DEXes, Constant Product Formula etc, thanks to the documentation provided in the frontend of the challenge.  
Then, once assimilated the concepts (considering that the target audience is beginner-level) and understood what an interesting attack vector could be - e.g. causing an imbalance in the liquidity pool - they'll solve the challenge by exploiting the public (rather than internal) function `_moveAmountToFeesPool()`.

## Challenge scenario

![first_view](./assets/first_view.png)

There are `swap`, `docs` and `connection` routes in the frontend. Players also have the Challenge Handler and the source code of the Smart Contracts available.

### Docs

![Documentation page](./assets/docs.png)
On this page players will have all the necessary information and concepts to solve the challenge, in case they don't know them.
This is done to provide a clear path to the player, without risking ending up in long searches or unnecessary rabbit holes.
Furthermore key aspects are highlighted, to give some hints:

![](./assets/highlighted_key_aspect.png)

### Swap

![Swap page](./assets/swap.png)
This is the page where you can swap and see the token balances.

> **_NOTE:_** 
> This UI is working and was made to make the challenge less abstract and/or insidious. However, with only frontend interaction it is not possible to solve the challenge. Players are thus forced to understand how to interact with the smart contract to use all the functions available and exploit the DEX.
### Connection

![Connection page](./assets/connection.png)
Connection info also accessible via the Challenge Handler.

### Challenge Handler
![Challenge Handler](./assets/challenge_handler.png)

Since this challenge was built on top of the [Paradigm 2022 CTF infrastructure](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/paradigm-ctf-infrastructure), it's available to player the Challenge Handler to Start a new instance of the challenge, Kill it, or Get the flag if condition are satisfied.

### Setup.sol
This is the setup contract used to deploy challenge contracts and check if solution condition are satisfied.
Players starts with `10 WETH` and to solve the challenge they have to manage to steal some from the Brokenswap contract.

### Brokenswap.sol
This is the code where all the DEX logics happens.

The code is richly commented on every line and functionality, with the integration of the documentation it's almost immediate to understand how it works.

```

The FeesPool contract is the responsibile pool which stores the fees collected from each swap on Brokenswap, where only the owner (the deployer of the contract i.e. the `Setup.sol` address) can withdraw the funds.
Players will be able to use the `balanceTokenA()` and `balanceTokenB()` functions to view the status of the pool during the resolution of the challenge. 
### Other Contracts
The `HTBtoken.sol`, `WETH9.sol` contracts, and libraries are not part of the challenge scope but were needed. 
The Openzeppelin libraries were used, probably the most secure and most used in the field. This gives players the opportunity to learn what Openzeppelin is and exclude any vulnerabilities within these smart contracts for the purposes of the challenge.

# Solution

Once we read the documentation we therefore understood that:
1) To allow the correct functioning of the DEX, according to the Constant Product Formula, the **INVARIANT**, i.e. the product of the quantity of tokens must remain, in fact, invariant.
2) The price of token B is simply given by `y = k/x` where:
   - `x` represents the amount of TokenA in the Liquidity Pool.
   - `y` represents the amount of TokenB in the Liquidity Pool.
   - `k` is the constant value determined when liquidity is initially added.
    And vice versa.
3) The curve representing this function allows us to visualize how the quantity of tokens in the pool will never end, providing infinite liquidity to the protocol. This is due to the fact that the curve never intersects with the axes that represent the balance of tokens in the pool.

> *For a quantity of Token A that approaches 0, the quantity of Token B **MUST** approach infinity. This "MUST" imperative consequently dictates the price at each swap. According to the law of demand and supply, the more an asset becomes scarce, the more its value increases.*

### So how can we exploit this logic to steal funds from the protocol?

**Answer**: By breaking rule number 1 which allows it to function entirely, i.e. when the **INVARIANT** *varies* (and as the name suggests, this should not happen).

How can we do it?
In the source code of `Brokenswap.sol` you can see how there is a function, with a naming convention different from the others. That is, the function `_moveAmountToFeesPool()`:

![](./assets/_moveAmountToFeesPool.png)

In fact, as the function's NatSpec describes, `_moveAmountToFeesPool()` is meant to be an **Internal** function. However, notice how it actually has the `public` modifier!

With this informations - having no other options - we can understand that:
>by moving an arbitrary number of tokens out of the Brokenswap Liquidity Pool and making a token that we already own more scarce it'll grow in value.
>***Note*** how the function accepts any quantity of any token, it is therefore not limited to the quantity of fees collected.
## Exploitation

0) Starting balance:
![WETH balance before the attack](./assets/weth_balance_before_hack.png)

1) We need to gain WETH tokens. To make them gain value, firstly we need to swap some of them in HTB token.
![Initializating the WETH/HTB swap](./assets/weth-htb_swap.png)
![Finalizing the WETH/HTB swap](./assets/weth-htb_swap_successfull.png)
![WETH balance after swap](./assets/weth_balance_after_swap.png)

2) Exploiting the Liquidity Pool by calling the `_moveAmountToFeesPool()` with arbitrary amount of tokens to move to arbitrary location. For demonstration we'll get out of the Liquidity Pool 498 of the remaining HTB tokens, meaning that it'll become extremely scarce and our ~2 HTB token swapped previously extremely valuable.
```shell
cast send $BROKENSWAP_ADDRESS "_moveAmountToFeesPool(address,uint256)" $HTB_TOKEN_ADDRESS 498000000000000000000 --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PVK
```

3) Swap back the HTB tokens to drain the WETH tokens in the Liquidity Pool and become rich. 
![Finalizing the HTB/WETH swap](./assets/htb-weth_swap_successfull.png)

4) We now have (way) more WETH balance than before:
![WETH balance after the attack](./assets/weth_balance_after_hack.png)

5) Get the flag (who cares of the WETHs)
